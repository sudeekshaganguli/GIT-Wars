# The branch where magic happens


# But Let's Talk Real World #2
- Each branch has a motif that it exist, when your project gets bigger and bigger you cannot afford to break your working/stable code. 
- This dev branch basically means that, the developers are working on PROBABLE new features and often developer try out new things here. If the test was successful, the feature might move onto dev branch.
- As soon as the features in comes close to stable, the features of this branch are merged in the dev branch.  

# Hints

- If you can do the above step, great you are at an advance GIT level. 
- As soon as the above task is done, merge the dev branch into main branch and give conflict priority to dev branch.
